# Three Types of Pages

Atomic Wiki uses three simple page types. Technically, they’re all just pages with a different `Type` value, but they have different purposes:

### Note – evergreen knowledge 

A **note** stores knowledge you want to keep and improve over time. It’s the core “atomic” unit of your wiki.

- Not tied to a specific day. 
- Meant to be updated, refactored, and linked.
- Great for patterns, reference material, how-tos, design decisions, and concepts.

### Post – a private article or story

A **post** is a more polished, narrative piece of writing. Think “blog post”, but private and local.

- Has a date, but isn’t just a log line.
- Often tells a story, explains a decision, or walks through an experience.
- Less evergreen than a note, more structured than a journal entry.

### Journal entry – time-based log

A **journal entry** is a snapshot of a moment in time. It’s meant to be quick, honest, and time-stamped.

- Always tied to a specific date (and optionally time).
- Great for daily logs, small wins, frustrations, or experiments.
- You don’t polish these much; you just capture what happened.

## How They Work Together

All three types are stored as pages in the same system. They share the same building blocks: title, content, tags, category, and timestamps. The only difference is how you use them.

- **Journal entries** capture what happened.
- **Posts** tell the story of what you learned or decided.
- **Notes** distill that learning into reusable, evergreen knowledge.

A typical flow looks like this:

1. You try something and jot it down as a **journal entry**.
2. Once it sticks, you write a **post** about what worked and why.
3. Then you extract the core ideas into one or more **atomic notes**.
