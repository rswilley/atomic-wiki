# Why Atomic Wiki?

Atomic Wiki is a private, local-only space for your ideas, experiments, and reference material. It takes inspiration from personal wikis, blogs, and "second brain" systems, but keeps everything on your machine, under your control.

The core idea is straightforward: instead of giant, messy documents, you create lots of small, focused pages that link together. Over time, those little pieces add up to a powerful personal knowledge base.
