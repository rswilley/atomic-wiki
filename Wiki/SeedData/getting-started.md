# How to Get Started

- Create a few **notes** for the topics you care about the most.
- Use **journal entries** as a daily or weekly log of what you’re doing.
- When something feels important, write a **post** to explain it to yourself.
- Link related pages together with internal links and tags.

Over time, you’ll end up with a personal knowledge system that reflects how you think, not how a tool thinks you should.
