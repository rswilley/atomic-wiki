# Local First and Private by Design

Atomic Wiki is designed to run on locally with no external dependencies:

- No external analytics or tracking scripts.
- No CDNs required; everything can be served from local files.
- Your content lives in a single folder on your machine.
- It’s your knowledge, your ideas, your experiments – and they stay on your machine.
