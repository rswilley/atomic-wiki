# The Philosophy of Atomic Notes

An **atomic note** is a small, self-contained piece of knowledge that captures one idea and can stand on its own. It’s not meant to be a full book chapter or a dumping ground of everything you know. It’s closer to a single building block.

- Each note has **one main idea**.
- Notes are **evergreen** – you refine them over time as your understanding improves.
- Notes **link to other notes**, forming a graph instead of a strict hierarchy.
- Notes are **short enough to re-read quickly** and update when needed.

This makes it easy to add a little bit at a time: you don’t need a huge block of free time to "organize your life" – you create or refine one atomic note whenever something matters.
