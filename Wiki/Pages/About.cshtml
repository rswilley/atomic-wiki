                A local-first, single-user wiki for building a personal knowledge system from small, connected pieces.

            <h2 class="h5">Why Atomic Wiki?</h2>
            <p>
                Atomic Wiki is a private, local-only space for your ideas, experiments, and reference material.
                It takes inspiration from personal wikis, blogs, and “second brain” systems, but keeps everything
                on your machine, under your control.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core idea is simple:
                instead of giant, messy documents, you create lots of small, focused pages
                that link together. Over time, those little pieces add up to a powerful
                personal knowledge base.

            <h2 class="h5">The philosophy of atomic notes</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>atomic note</strong> is a small, self-contained piece of knowledge that captures one idea
                and can stand on its own. It’s not meant to be a full book chapter or a dumping ground of everything
                you know. It’s closer to a single building block.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each note has <strong>one main idea</strong>.</li>
                <li>Notes are <strong>evergreen</strong> – you refine them over time as your understanding improves.</li>
                <li>Notes <strong>link to other notes</strong>, forming a graph instead of a strict hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Notes are <strong>short enough to re-read quickly</strong> and update when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This makes it easy to add a little bit at a time:
                you don’t need a huge block of free time to “organize your life” –
                you just create or refine one atomic note whenever something matters.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h5">Three types of pages</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Atomic Wiki uses three simple page types. Technically they’re all just
                pages with a different <code>Type</code> value, but they have different purposes:
            </p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1. Note – evergreen knowledge</h3>
            <p>
                A <strong>note</strong> stores knowledge you want to keep and improve over time.
                It’s the core “atomic” unit of your wiki.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not tied to a specific day.</li>
                <li>Meant to be updated, refactored, and linked.</li>
                <li>Great for patterns, reference material, how-tos, design decisions, and concepts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                Examples: “Orleans concurrency patterns”, “AI visual workflow for techno mixes”,
                “Atomic Wiki architecture”.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">2. Post – a private article or story</h3>
            <p>
                A <strong>post</strong> is a more polished, narrative piece of writing.
                Think “blog post”, but private and local.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Has a date, but isn’t just a log line.</li>
                <li>Often tells a story, explains a decision, or walks through an experience.</li>
                <li>Less evergreen than a note, more structured than a journal entry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                Examples: “Why I’m building Atomic Wiki”, “The story behind the floating island animation”,
                “My Tesla charging routine and why it works”.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h6 mt-3">3. Journal entry – time-based log</h3>
            <p>
                A <strong>journal entry</strong> is a snapshot of a moment in time.
                It’s meant to be quick, honest, and time-stamped.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always tied to a specific <strong>date</strong> (and optionally time).</li>
                <li>Great for daily logs, small wins, frustrations, or experiments.</li>
                <li>You don’t polish these much; you just capture what happened.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                Examples: “2025-03-01 – Late night mix session”, “AI visuals experiment log”, “Tesla charging log”.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h5">How they work together</h2>
            <p>
                All three types are stored as pages in the same system. They share the same building blocks:
                title, content, tags, category, and timestamps. The only difference is how you <em>use</em> them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Journal entries</strong> capture what happened.</li>
                <li><strong>Posts</strong> tell the story of what you learned or decided.</li>
                <li><strong>Notes</strong> distill that learning into reusable, evergreen knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A typical flow looks like this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>You try something and jot it down as a <strong>journal entry</strong>.</li>
                <li>Once it sticks, you write a <strong>post</strong> about what worked and why.</li>
                <li>Then you extract the core ideas into one or more <strong>atomic notes</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h5">Local-first and private by design</h2>
            <p>
                Atomic Wiki is designed to run on <strong>localhost</strong> with no external dependencies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No external analytics or tracking scripts.</li>
                <li>No CDNs required; everything can be served from local files.</li>
                <li>Your content lives in a single database or folder on your machine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It’s your knowledge, your ideas, your experiments – and they stay on your machine.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h5">How to get started</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a few <strong>notes</strong> for the topics you care about the most.</li>
                <li>Use <strong>journal entries</strong> as a daily or weekly log of what you’re doing.</li>
                <li>When something feels important, write a <strong>post</strong> to explain it to yourself.</li>
                <li>Link related pages together with internal links and tags.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Over time, you’ll end up with a personal knowledge system that reflects how <em>you</em> think,
                not how a tool thinks you should.
